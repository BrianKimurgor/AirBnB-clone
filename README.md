AirBnB Clone is a project that aims to build a website similar to AirBnB. It is a complete web application that includes a database for storing data, a back-end API for handling requests, and a front-end interface for user interaction.

This project is a great opportunity  to learn about web development and gain hands-on experience in building a full web application.

#Description

The first step in building the AirBnB Clone is to create a custom command-line interface (CLI) for managing data and the base classes for storing this data.

The CLI is similar to a Unix shell, where users can enter commands and interact with the application. In our project, we use the command (hbnb) as the prompt for entering commands.

Here are some example commands that can be used in the CLI:

help: Displays a list of available commands and provides information on how to use them.
create : Creates a new object of a specific class and prints its unique identifier.
destroy  : Deletes an object of a specific class with the given identifier.
show  : Displays the details of an object of a specific class with the given identifier.
all or all : Displays all objects or instances of a specific class.
quit: Exits the CLI and ends the program.

To run the CLI,
Clone the repository to your local machine,
Navigate to the directory, (where the console.py is)
You can use the command ./console.py in your terminal.
